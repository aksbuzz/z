### the lists are for a fresh debian (sid, ish) install  
the.list -- /etc/apt/sources.list.d/the.list  
unused.list -- ...unused...

dpkg.list -- actually `apt-get install -f -y` list, but that doesn't look as good  
npm.list -- `npm i -g` all these things  
pip.list -- lol what's a venv  
pip3.list -- or pipp3.4, or pip3.seventeen, or python6-easy_pip.tools... whatever works
