### the lists are for a fresh debian (sid, ish) install
the.list    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/the.list  
unused.list    ...unused...  
---------
dpkg.list    actually `apt-get install -f -y` list, but that doesn't look as good  
npm.list    `npm i -g` all these things  
pip.list    lol what's a venv 
pip3.list   or pip3.4, or pip3.seventeen, or python6-easy_pip.tools... whatever works  
---------
bin is *slightly* cleaner now. all docs moved to man/, after a disaster involving a static site script and every markdown file to which it had permissions.... this should make it a wee bit easier to restore from an offline pc next time.
