### the lists are for a fresh debian (sid, ish) install

`the.list`  --  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/the.list  
`unused.list`  --  unused sources.list entries

---------

`dpkg.list`  --  actually `apt-get install -fy` list, but that's not so succinct  
`npm.list`  --  `npm i -g` all these things  
`pip2.list`  --  lol what's a venv  
`pip3.list`  --  or ~~pip3.4~~ pip3.5, or pip3.seventeen, or python6-easy_pip.tools... whatever works  

---------

I should point out that I don't use Textadept often, I have the configs saved here for the next time I get really annoyed with Vim or LightTable. And I don't use VS Code _ever_, because it's actually still a piece of crap, but I saved that config file because it took ages to get Code to work halfway like a real editor, and I don't ever want to have to do it again. I'll give that shit another shit if they ever figure out basic functionality like code folding or tabs.
