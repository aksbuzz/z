Various strange, incomprehensible twisty snippets of
code. Warning: Perl.

megascript.c
  Something I wrote a couple of years ago. It's just Hello,
  World. But, the same file is Hello, World in C, C++, awk,
  perl, python, sh, bash and tcl.

mu
  My login in Netsoc is "mu", and here's a short blob of
  strange Perl which was my homepage for a while.

quine
  I was asked to make something for the back of Netsoc
  hoodies, and this is the result. Run it, check its
  output. Run it with the argument "netsoc". Run it with the
  argument "almondbread" (bonus points if you figure that
  one out before running it). Run it with the argument
  "mu". And, the grand finale, compare the md5sum of the
  original file with the md5sum of it's output with the
  argument "netsoc". If you notice something in common,
  google it. The results may be... interesting :D

japh.py
  A short example of a particularly, erm, "minimalist"
  coding style in Python, eschewing the use of such
  unnecessary crutches as letters and numbers. This file
  may not be entirely PEP-8 compliant.
