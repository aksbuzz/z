I HAVE NO IDEA


A good bit of this stuff is actually just a total mess. Bits and pieces from different distros I've used at some point or another... possibly things labeled .md that are actually shell scripts... I really just don't know. Maybe I'll organize, one day. Anything I've grabbed from online somewhere, credits will be in there. The exceptions, if any, are snippets found without much info; comments on blog posts, paste services, etc.
