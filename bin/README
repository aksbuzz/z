A lot of this is a mess. I'm working on cleaning it up a bit, though. Moved all docs/manpages to man/. I'm not too fond of extensions... almost all of the bash scripts don't have them, because typing `whatever.sh | thingy.sh' and 'blah.sh' and `.sh .sh .shshshshshsh` can get old right quick. Some Python bits are probably also missing extensions. Same story.  

Virtually everything in here was stolen from someone, probably. Anywhere there were credits, I believe I've left them intact. Some things might not have them--most likely I those would be bits pulled from comments on blog posts, anonymous paste services, or whatever. If it's your code and it doesn't mention you, please do let me know.  

At some point I'll actually get a blog/site generator (probably in Bash) figured out, which'll be in here... as well as a script to keep all this (and ../) updated automatically (from my Dropbox, where this git repo lives), and also to just link to these instead of duplicating on every box....
