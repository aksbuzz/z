2003-05-30 19:28  ed

2003-02-23 21:14  ed

	* TODO: Added URL for Rubber.

2003-01-01 22:29  ed

	* TODO: Todo list.

2003-01-01 22:25  ed

	with zero pages.

2002-10-22 22:51  ed

	* README: Added a warning about 'make test' failure on Windows.

2002-10-22 22:48  ed

	* pip.in, test.pl: New -I (buffer stdin) and -O (buffer stdout)
	flags.

2002-10-22 22:48  ed

	* pip_tex: Remove the .idx and .toc files created by a LaTeX run. 
	Actually, we ought to keep these and use them to run latex for a
	second pass, but multiple passes are yet to be implemented.

2002-10-18 23:18  ed

	* mkdist: Remove the ChangeLog.bak file sometimes created by
	cvs2cl.

2002-10-18 23:16  ed

	* mkdist: Fixes seemingly needed for perl 5.005.

2002-10-18 22:48  ed

	* pip.in: New $CLEANUP variable controls whether to unlink
	temporary files and directories on exit.

2002-10-18 15:15  ed

	* pip.in: Make the temporary directory under /tmp/ (or other
	appropriate place).  I think that before it was being made relative
	to the current directory, or something.

2002-10-18 14:56  ed

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, README, mkdist, pip.PL, pip.in,
	pip_latex2html, pip_tex: Version 1.1: added pip_latex2html and some
	more information on BUGS in pip_tex.  Rewrote the mkdist script in
	Perl so it can check version numbers across several files.  Updated
	the README.

2002-10-18 13:11  ed

	* Makefile.PL, pip.in, pip_tex: Replaced some of the home-grown
	temporary file routines with File::Temp::tempdir().  Perhaps more
	still to do.

2002-09-17 20:48  ed

	* pip_tex: Documenting the bug found by regis@grison.org - loading
	files from the current directory doesn't work.

2002-09-17 20:23  ed

	* pip.in: Chris Coyle <chrisco@sprint.ca> pointed out the existence
	of process substitution and said I should mention it in the manual
	page.

2002-09-17 20:16  ed

	* pip_tex: Fix suggested by Hans Fredrik Nordhaug
	<hansfn@mi.uib.no>: check return value of getopts().

2002-09-05 16:02  ed

	* pip.in: Added a 'DESCRIPTION' section to keep pod2man happy.

2002-09-05 16:01  ed

	* mkdist, pip.in, pip_tex: Fixed Changes generation; altered the
	documentation to stop pod2man complaints.

2002-09-05 15:49  ed

	* COPYING, MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP, Makefile.PL, README, mkdist,
	pip, pip.PL, pip.in, pip_latex, pip_tex, test.pl: Packaged up for
	version 1.0.  There's now a Makefile.PL and a test suite in
	test.pl.  Manual pages for pip and pip_tex are generated from their
	pod documentation.  (And pip_tex is now the official name;
	pip_latex is a symlink created by the mkdist script, though both
	are installed separately by the Makefile.)  Changed copying
	conditions to GPL.  Made nice --help and --version options.
	
	Fixed a security hole with use of /tmp; there is still the chance
	of a DoS attack but nothing more serious I hope.
	
	Added a new -b switch to pip which specifies a placeholder should
	be used for both input and output.  For example, this CVS log
	message I'm typing now could be implemented using 'pip -b xemacs
	-'.
	
	I just hope it still works on Windows.

2002-08-31 22:52  ed

	address and website.

	* pip: removed 'use diagnostics' for speed
	(tmpnam()): use our own tmpnam() instead of POSIX - 8 char limit

		the output filename, and recover (but give a warning).
	* pip: version 0.2
