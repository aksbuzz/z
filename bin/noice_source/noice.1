.Sh NAME
.Nm noice
.Nd small file browser
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm noice
.Op Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple and efficient file browser that gets out of your way
as much as possible.  It was initially implemented to be controlled
with a TV remote control.
.Pp
.Nm
defaults to the current directory if
.Ar dir
is not specified.  As an extra feature, if
.Ar dir
is a relative path,
.Nm
will not go back beyond the first component of the path using standard
navigation key presses.
.Pp
.Nm
supports both vi-like and emacs-like key bindings in the default
configuration.  The default key bindings are described below;
their functionality is described in more detail later.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "l, [Right], [Return] or C-mXXXX" -offset indent -compact

.It Ic h, [Left] or [Backspace]

.Pp
Backing up one directory level will set the cursor position at the
directory you came out of.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
is configured by modifying
.Pa config.h
and recompiling the code.
.Pp
The file associations are specified by regexes
matching on the currently selected filename.  If a match is found the associated
program is executed with the filename passed in as the argument.  If no match
is found the program
.Xr less 1
is invoked.  This is useful for editing text files
as one can use the 'v' command in
.Xr less 1 to edit the file in $EDITOR.
.Pp
See the examples section below for more information.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters allow you to use regexes to display only the matched
entries in the current directory view.  This effectively allows
searching through the directory tree for a particular entry.
.Pp
Filters do not stack on top of each other.  They are applied anew
every time.
.Pp
To reset the filter you can input an empty filter expression.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is invoked as root the default filter will also match hidden
files.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows one possible configuration for
file associations which is also the default:
.Bd -literal
struct assoc assocs[] = {
	{ "\\.(avi|mp4|mkv|mp3|ogg|flac)$", "mplayer" },
	{ "\\.(png|jpg|gif)$", "feh" },
	{ "\\.(html|svg)$", "firefox" },
	{ "\\.pdf$", "mupdf" },
	{ "\\.sh$", "sh" },
	{ ".", "less" },
};

.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
If you are using urxvt you might have to set backspacekey to DEC.
