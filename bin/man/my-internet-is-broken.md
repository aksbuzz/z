### 3 Introduction

It is an old and common joke among experienced
computer users to say: "my Internet is broken."
Usually they refer to a temporal unavailability of
a working Internet connection probably due to
technical circumstances. The origins of this
proverb lie in not-so-experienced computer users,
like for example the mother or father of a coder,
that used that or a similar phrase from time to
time. Obviously "their Internet" --whatever that
may be-- was not broken, but their connection
was. Anyway.

What most IT-workers and users don't seem
to realize today is that their Internet is really
broken. And worse: really large parts of the
whole Internet are!

### 4 History

The Internet as we know it consists of several
parts. The most important is probably the
WWW, the World Wide Web with it's myriad of
pages, closely followed by the email system. The
idea of connecting several computers at different
locations goes back to the US military in the
sixties when they were eager to ensure their
data storage. Shortly afterwards the science
community started using the network for it's own
purposes.

Then suddenly in 1990 Tim Berners Lee at
CERN in Geneva invented the world wide web
by creating the HTTP, the HyperText Transport
Protocol and the HTML, the Hypertext Markup
Language. The idea, the fundamental principles,
of the young WWW were a simple structured
representation of (mainly scientific) information
mixed with the highly inventive addition of
hyper-links. Hey, what a great idea. Of course it
was not totally new (think of SGML. . . ) but
history tells that this made a change. The
pioneers of the WWW imagined a distributed
pool of documents and all of them knitted
together with links, thus forming a very, very large meta-document.

In this document the WWW shall be discussed.
You probably can tell from your mailbox that
something went wrong with the email thing
anyway. ;-).

### 5 Advertising

Some day there came the misuse of the HTML
graphic capabilities in form of advertising. A
small web-site could raise some money by
showing ads on the top of it's pages thus maybe
paying the monthly online costs or the costs of
the web-hosting. Not did the webmasters see
they were being attacked. Attacked by the usual
means of global capitalism: give 'em money, buy
them out.

Not that capitalism is a bad thing per se,
it's just too big a hungry beast to feed for
much longer. Capitalism managed to quiet
movements such as Hippie, Punk and Hip-Hop
simply by buying it's evangelists. No matter
what the Sex Pistols might have said. But I
digress.

Advertising banners made web pages weighing
more, made them slower to load. All of a sudden
you needed a ridiculous amount of that rare
resource bandwidth to gather a comparatively
small mass of information from the WWW. Of
course banner blocking was a great discussion at
that time, but that's not this story.

Now let us think: what is the idea of
advertising? Obviously selling something. But
that means that The Companies already diffused
into the virtual realm. Once again this is not a
bad thing per se. I really hate companies that
have no --or even worse: a bad-- web-site giving
me all the information I want, it's just that
companies bring a bunch of shit-flies that tend to
create a lot of hassle.

First there are their advertising compartments
and with them they brought pixel-exact design.
They had done this for years in print so why
should they adapt that creepy new standard that
those freaky scientists came up with? Pixel-exact
design and the much too long time it took
to come up with a technology, an accepted
standard, to produce it (just asking: why did
it take such a long time?) killed structured
information right away. It was more important to
exactly determine where on the visitors screen a
navigation button should show up than to
arrange the content cleanly. What about an
automatic and intelligent information agent?
Huh? What about a visitor with a different
browser? They are too few! What about people
with low bandwidth? Uninteresting customers!
What about the blind or otherwise disabled?
Fuck them!

But it got even worse than that!

### 6 The Legal Era

So, the companies have infected this part
of the Internet and companies are usually
fighting a few wars. They are fighting against
countries and their governments for better (that
is profit increasing) laws. This involves a lot of
lobbyism. They fight against organizations
such as Greenpeace or trade unions because
of their stupid profit decreasing ideas and
ideals. This involves long time generation of
fear among the workers (fear for their jobs
that is) such as visible in these days so much.
And --most important-- they fight each other.
What am I supposed to think when I read that
company AA sues company AB for patent
infringement while at same time they are doing
some other business perfectly well together?
Weird. The means of that war are: courts and
lawyers.

I really don't want to offend all the law-workers
in one piece, I know some very kind and intelligent
humans among them. On the other hand I have
come across some really weird thinkers from
that group, people compared to which that
mad scientist you find in so many movies
and books really appears like a very sensible
guy.

And then the machinery sets to work. Since a
web-page can be accessed worldwide it's content
might be judged by whatever law seems fitting.Some extremely arrogant countries really believe
that a person living somewhere on this globe
should be put under their laws when performing
some Internet stunt. Because a stunt it has
become. In Germany there was recently a case
filed that addressed an Italian restaurant in some
city which had a very common name. Honestly,
in every city in Germany with more than 50 000
inhabitants you'll probably find an Italian
restaurant named "Bella Italia" and one called
"Bello Fiore". And that is perfectly fine because
they all act locally. But no! You only have to get
a trademark on one of those names and find
those restaurants that have a web-site (which
probably tells nothing more than when the
location is open, where it is and maybe some
prices), since a web-site is globally available. Hm,
who knows maybe "bello fiore" means "suck my
dick" in one of those languages that I don't
know?

We all have read one or the other Internet
court decision that appear really stupid to those
who understand what the Internet and the
WWW are all about. I for one have lost a good
deal of money in such a process when I played in
a band which had a name similar to that
of a large candy producer. That band had
played an amazing total of 5 gigs, mostly for
free drinks, and was sued for an even more
amazing sum of 1 Million DM (German Marks).
Huh?

### 7 Consequences

So, today when you are so bold to create a
web-site, no matter what it is all about, it's
best to consult a lawyer to be really sure. In
Germany you probably need to have a so
called Impressum which states that you are
responsible for that work and probably contains
your postal address (and the spammer says
thanks. . . ). And remember to be very, very
careful when choosing the domain name. Not
only you might accidentally use a registered
trademark or the name of a company or a
domain-name that might be close to such
a thing or a domain-name that might just
sound close to such a thing, no you might even
use your own name and loose in the court
because the right of a company which has the
same name is somehow righter than yours.
And when you just show your private photo
collection you'd better ask all the persons that
might be in the background of a photograph
for permission, and are you really sure that
no one already took a shot from the same
view as you did and is selling the image over
the Internet? It is also a good idea not to
speak too loud. Don't let your web-site become
too well known because if they just search
enough they'll find something to sue you for.
And be careful of what you say, you might
offend someone. Ah yes, don't forget to add a
disclaimer for the content of linked pages,
that are obviously written and maintained by
someone else but might be connected to your
page because of that link thing (which certain
people seemingly didn't understand at all). And
. . .

You know what? Don't link to other pages,
don't provide any content, any information. Best
not to have a web-page at all!

Man, I think my Internet is broken!

### 8 Disclaimer

    way, although that someone tells you that
    he does not intend to insult anyone in
    particular,
*   if you don't know all the following words or don't have the ability to detect their
    presence: "sarcasm", "parody", "irony",
*   you are ill-minded towards the author
    anyway.
