If you don't want to launch a command line each time under Linux, you can use
the given bash script ``PyEdit.bash``. Open it and at line 3, replace my:

"/home/kib/Public/Japes/PyEdit2"

with the directory where PyEdit's ``main.py`` resides.

For command-line launching, just type :
"python main.py" or "python main.py myfiletoedit" where ``myfiletoedit`` is 
i.e 'my_text.tex'.
