Summary: An excursion on Usenet wars, with cast by Mark Twain
</pre>
A couple of years ago, when Kibo still moved upon the face of Usenet, he
and his followers engaged in a guerilla campaign to ridicule the earnest
habitues of rec.org.mensa.  I didn't follow much of the skirmishing,
myself, but I sympathized with Kibological disdain for the Mensa
presence on the Net: why on earth make a big deal of being measurably
smarter than 98% of your fellow humans when basically *everyone* on
Usenet already was, without being so insecure as to join a special club
to prove it?
<p>
Whether or not they really could have qualified for Mensa entrance, most
people on the Net believed in what John Erskine once called "the moral
obligation to be intelligent" (title of a Phi Beta Kappa address at
Amherst, collected in a book of essays that went through six editions in
the 1910s and '20s).  Granted, it was a sometimes skewed definition of
intelligence, highly rationalist, enamored of formal systems, reflecting
the technical training of many Netters.  Like Kibo, I came to the Net
from  an English major's background, and even if I couldn't understand
how so many brilliant computer geeks could take Ayn Rand seriously or
consider M.C. Escher the century's greatest visual artist, I totally
grokked his joy at the sheer exuberance of mind and language you found
in almost every corner of Usenet.  Of course there were always the
lunatics and misanthropes, but they added to the fabric the way Lear's
fool or Iago did to Shakespeare.
<p>
So what astounds and appalls long-time Usenetters and their spiritual
allies among the newcomers is not just the invasion of stupidity, but of
aggressive stupidity, stupidity that brays out its right to exist,
stupidity that sees its swelling ranks as the prophecy of its ultimate
victory in a war against a doomed elite, a war that it casts explicitly
as class warfare.
<p>
You know what, though?  The stupid people are right.  This *is* class
warfare, and anyone on the Net who wants to lay claim to intelligence is
going to have to do some soul-searching over the fact.
<p>
What drove this home for me is the current flap, in the United States,
over the state of daytime television talk shows, which have degenerated
into sleaze-fest investigations of subcultural behavior with titles like
"Women Who Sleep with Their Kids' Parole Officers".  Walter Goodman has
a piece in today's (Nov. 1) New York Times called "Daytime TV Talk:
The Issue of Class".  See if his descriptions of talk-show viewers and
participants, and the reaction they provoke, remind you of anything
else:
<p>
<blockquote>
    [The critics fail to acknowledge] that what is upsetting them is
    the appearance of an American underclass in all its ignorance and
    tastelessness. ...
<p>
    Day after day, these shows ... feature people who seem to come
    from some contemporary version of Dickens's London. ... What they
    lack in grammar they make up in volume as they attack their
    mothers, sisters and lovers, describe their odd couplings and bare
    their most private miseries and peculiarities...
<p>
    What can possibly draw them there? ... Where else can life's
    losers win so much attention?
</blockquote>
Yep. He's talking about us. The Net Police are going to have to sue
Goodman for swiping a trademarked Usenet motto in that last sentence.
<p>
And now imagine what an uproar everyone would be in if TV worked the way
Usenet does: if PBS shows were interrupted every couple of minutes by
Howard Stern or a blaring commercial for Spam, or if all the broadcasts
on Channel Four were constantly jammed by some maniac exposing the
insidious plot of John Major, as a direct descendant of the Gunpowder
Plot cabal, to grant Ireland rule over England, abolish the House of
Commons, and move the Vatican to Hampstead Heath, while making
homosexuality compulsory for British citizenship.
<p>
The weird thing about the Usenet class war is that doesn't just follow
traditional socioeconomic lines.  So far as I can tell, there are as
many spoiled rich kids in the Stupid Army as there are members of any
conventional underclass.  (True story: a professor at a private
university complained to the Dean of Students about a student who every
day would blare music from his dorm room right across from the
professor's afternoon class; the kid protested loudly that this practice
was "part of his culture" and that the professor had no right to try to
suppress it.  Now where have we heard *that* argument lately...?)
<p>
Still, it might help to map the current Usenet Wars onto more familiar
stories of class and social conflict, to understand what's at stake.
Taking a cue from Goodman's Dickens reference, I offer the American
equivalent in the following scenario. 
<h2>
What if the Characters from "Huckleberry Finn" Were on Usenet?
</h2>
[To quote Mark Twain: "Persons attempting to find a moral in this
narrative will be prosecuted"--I've retained the services of the
distinguished John Grubor, J.D., of Internet Law Systems.]
<p>
Judge Thatcher: the established social order.  Genteel, learned,
dedicated to preserving the rule of law. --The System Administrator.
A David (tale) Lawrence, Chris Lewis, or Karen Lofstrom.
<p>
Pap Finn: the Judge's nemesis: what the tarnation right does the Judge
have, he bawls, taking his own son Huck away from him just because he
beats him and abandons him?  Hates people who make laws or show off their
book-larning, starting with Huck: "You're educated, too, they say--can
read and write.  You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you,
because he can't?  _I'll_ take it out of you."  --The Destroyer of
Netiquette. Stephen Boursy, his own self, ranting at his betters every
time the whiskey kicks in.
<p>
Tom Sawyer: solidly middle-class, but with aristocratic pretensions.
Theatrical, book-learned, self-dramatizing; happiest when the
whole village is focused on one of his shenanigans.  Just might
grow up to be Mark Twain, however.  --The Kibo principle, as currently
reincarnated in, for example, The BOB(c).
<p>
Old Boggs: rides into down drunk and cussing like blazes, insulting
the leading citizen and threatening to shoot everyone who crosses
his path--but the old-timers know he's just a harmless fool.
--The Newsgroup Blusterer, currently incarnated as John Grubor.
<p>
Jim: the voiceless one; others write for him, and force him into
their own scripts.  --The millions upon millions who are not here,
and who are infinitely more oppressed than anyone who doesn't like
a newsgroup charter or an ISP service contract will ever be.
<p>
Miss Watson: sticks Huck in a closet and preaches at him.  Denies
her own complicity in the immorality she condemns (she owns Jim).
--Doctress Neutopia.
<p>
The Duke and the King: two con men with fabricated pedigrees, happy as
pie to be in front of an audience of suckers, laughing up their sleeves
at the rubes who take them for aristocracy and get fleeced.  --The
Spammers. The slightly more literate and shabby-genteel Duke, Canter &amp;
Siegel; the vulgar backwoods low-life, Jeff Slaton.
<p>
The Mob, who tar and feather the Duke and the King, and ride them out of
town on a rail. --Who we'd all love to be.  If we could *only* get our
hands on those bastards...  (But Huck gets the last word on Lynch's law:
"It was a dreadful thing to see.  Human beings *can* be awful cruel to
one another."  In the end, maybe we have Judge Thatchers for a reason.)
<p>
Huck: Yes, what of poor Huck?  Naive, credulous, barely literate, yet
instinctively moral, risking his freedom to preserve Jim's; flees Pap
and sees through the Duke and the King for the shams they are; keeps
getting trapped by "civilization", which is sure it knows what Huck
needs.  --The teeming throngs of Usenet newbies, constantly being told
that AOL and Microsoft know best, bullied and recruited by the "adults",
yet capable of seeing through corporate greed and self-serving rant in
the end.  Or let's hope.
<p>
Let's hope.
