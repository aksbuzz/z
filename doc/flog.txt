FLOG (I)                      PWB/UNIX 4/1/77                     FLOG (I)

NAME
flog - speed up a process

SYNOPSIS
flog [-ln] [-am] [-u] process-id...

DESCRIPTION
Flog is used to simulate an improvement in the performance of a process that 
is already in execution.

The process-id is the number of the process that is to be disciplined.

The value n of the l keyletter argument is the flagellation constant, ie, the 
number of lashes to be administered per minute. If this argument is omitted, 
the default is 17, which is the most random number.

The value m of the keyletter argument is the number of times the inducement to 
speed up is to be administered. If this argument is omitted, the default is 
one, which is based on the possibility that after that the process will rectify
its behavior of its own volition.

The presence of the u keyletter argument indicates that flog is to be 
unmerciful in its actions. This nullifies the effects of the other keyletter 
arguments. It is recommended that this option be used only on extremely 
stubborn processes, as its over-use may have detrimental effects.

FILES
Flog will read the file /have/mercy for any entry containing the process-id of 
the process being speeded-up. The file can contain whatever supplications are 
deemed necessary, but, of course, these will be ignored if the u keyletter 
argument is supplied.

DIAGNOSTICS
If a named process does not exist, flog replies "flog you" on the standard 
output. If flog kill(II)s the process, which usually happens when the u 
keyletter is supplied, it writes "RIP", followed by the process-id of the 
deceased on the standard output.

BUGS
Spurious supplications for mercy by the process being flogged sometimes wind 
up on the standard output, rather than in /shut/up.
