## Think-Pair-Share
 
Think-Pair-Share is a learning strategy developed by Lyman; it is associated with encourage student classroom participation and interaction between students and facilitators. In this strategy, the question/problem will be posed by the facilitator and trainers are allowed to think about it individually, and then discuss in pairs to solve the problem and finally share their ideas to the class. This strategy could also be used for spur-of-the-moment discussions, in other word refreshing their brains after a long dayâ€™s theory lesson. It is different to traditional learning styles where facilitators pose a question/ problem and randomly pick a participator to answer the question. Indeed it provides an opportunity for all trainers to share and analyse the question from different points of view and also shares to at least one other person.

#### Purpose
- Increase training interaction and involve all the trainers
- Allow quite trainers be confident to present their idea to everyone since they have already share their idea to peer which have been accepted
- Strategy as spur-of-the-moment
- Facilitator performance evaluation, tell the facilitator what the trainers understand
- Active learning
- Provide opportunity and practice trainers's communication, listening and analysis skills
- Build network or friendship between peers

#### Advantage
- All trainers are engaged in the thinking process, including those quiet students
- Trainers feel more comfortable and find it easier to get in a discussion with person next to them rather than a table group
- Any topic could be a topic of discussion in this strategy
- Active learning is a remarkable learning style for trainers
- Shows the importance of having partnership or team work
- Improves the communication skills
- Help trainers fix the content of the lesson in their memories when the class has an hour duration
- Develop skills in small-group discussion
- Everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in training activities
- High degree of interaction and engagement between trainers and facilitator 
- Trainers are motivated to learn as they enjoy the socializing component.       

#### Disadvantage
- Time consuming
- Hard to assist all trainers during the discussion since they have so many groups
 
#### Hints for using Think-Pair-Share
- Facilitator should slow down the progress and explain more detail when first introduce think-pair-share in the training. Even though it will consume more time, trainers may get lost if Facilitator did not fully provide support and instruction.
- Let trainers know everyone could be called to explain their ideas to the class by using different picking methods such as drawing lots or assigning numbers to different groups and randomly selecting.
Facilitators should reward those trainers who answer the question, even they are picked randomly. Especially for younger age trainers , they will be willing to participate in the discussion.
- Provide enough time for trainers to think, discuss, and remind trainers of the time. trainers tend to summarise their discussion when the facilitator call out 1 minutes reminding
- Facilitators should monitor the entire time when trainers are having discussion, in order to assist trainers to discuss on the right track and relate to the question. However, due to the time -limitation, it is impossible to assist every trainers in the class.

#### Possible question
Basically any question could be used for think-pair-share such as open-end question, discussion question or true/false questions. However, questions that include comparing, contrasting and evaluation are recommended in order to increase the learning efficiency at class.
1. Identify the methods to use in recruiting
1. Which recruiting methods is the best practice
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using internet recruitment?
1. Why internet recruiting wide use by organisation
1. How would you evaluate the quality of a mobile/ camera/ vehicle?

#### Step of process a Think-Pair-Share
1. The facilitator should announce the think-pair-share activity at the beginning, then explain to trainers that everyone will get chance to be pick to answer the question/problem to the class. This action could motivate trainers to involve during the discussion since trainers knows that they will have an equal possibility to be picked.
1. Facilitators then need to address the issues, problems or questions to trainers and possibly provide addition material. In order to ensure trainers discuss on the right track, the facilitator should provide an example of an answer and explain in detail.
1. Hand out the think-pair-share worksheet to each trainer , suggest participators use different colour pen to finish each part of the worksheet.
1. Allow trainers to think independently for 5 minutes about the question given by the facilitator
1. Facilitator assist trainers pair up with one other trainer
1. Provide 3-5 minutes for each trainer to share their ideas to their peer and summarise their answer to present to class
1. Randomly pick 3-4 trainers to share their answer to entire class. The facilitator could use variety of methods to pick a trainer such as drawing lots
1. Facilitators should provide feedback, summarise and reward those trainers who have been picked

Trainers can either participate in two consecutive pairings or can pair with one trainer and then the first pair can be grouped with another pair to discuss their thoughts before joining a whole-class discussion. This double-pair method is particularly helpful if you have a very large training or are dealing with an especially complex question.
