# presentations
Knowing how to present things is excellent. Lacking good presentation is
catastrophic for your product; having excellent presentation can even make a
shitty product desirable.

## Plan d'attaque
1. name the enemy
2. answer "why now?"
3. show the promised land before explaining how you'll get there
4. Identify obstacles—then explain how you’ll overcome them
5. Present evidence that you’re not just blowing hot air
