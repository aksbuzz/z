<p>There are a number of grounding techniques that can be learned to decrease hyper-arousal and connect to the present. These include naming and listing things in the here and now and using as many senses as possible to reconnect to the present.</p>
<p>What follows are some techniques that have proved useful to some survivors - it&#39;s important to find what works for you and you can adapt the techniques to fit you.</p>
<p>Oases are activities that give a break from the trauma. They are activities that demand concentration and attention. Watching TV and reading do not usually work well as it is easy to wander into one&#39;s own thoughts.</p>
<p>Procedures that have not become automatic work best. These might include: gardening; following a pattern in embroidery or knitting; playing chess, solitaire or &#39;braintraining&#39; games; learning a language; doing  crosswords or jigsaws; creative writing; playing the piano. The value of an oasis will be recognised by a reduction in hyper-arousal and a quieting of internal dialogue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding a Safe Place or Activity</strong>
A safe place is a form of anchor to reduce the stress of working with traumatic memories. Anchors can be used as &#39;braking&#39; tools when the going gets rough. A suitable anchor is one that gives relief (in body and emotion) and a sense of well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is preferable that an anchor is chosen from real life experience, so that positive memories in both body and mind can be accessed. It is useful to work with your counsellor to establish in advance an anchor that can be used when needed in trauma work.</p>
<p>A safe place or activity is a current or remembered experience of protection. It should have associations of calmness and safety (as opposed to &#39;relaxing&#39; - which can feel unsafe for people who have experienced trauma, or &#39;pleasurable&#39; - which can be over- stimulating). It is preferable for the safe place/activity to be something real that is</p>
<p>known from life. This is because there will be somatic resonance in the memory - sights, sounds, smells, etc. which will be recorded as sensory memory traces and be highly accessible.</p>
<p>It is helpful to imagine the safe place/activity during times of stress and anxiety, or it can be used as an anchor, to reduce hyper-arousal during a therapy session.</p>
<p>Employing our own awareness of the state of our body - our perceptions of the precise, co-existing sensations that arise from internal and external stimuli - is a very useful tool in trauma work. This is because consciousness of current sensory stimuli is our primary</p>
<p>link to the here and now; it is also a direct link to our emotions.</p>
<p>Body awareness is about awareness of cues from the central nervous system. Body awareness (sensations) from exteroceptors originates from stimuli that have their origin outside of the body (touch, taste, smell, sounds, sights). Body awareness from interoceptors consists of sensations that originate on the inside of the body (connective tissue, muscles and viscera).</p>
<p>Separating past from present can be accomplished on a body level. During a flashback or trauma work getting up and moving (e.g. walking around or moving from one room to another) will help to reinforce the here-and-now reality that the trauma is no longer occurring. &#39;I could not move then, but I can move now.&#39; Moving can also help to complete a sequence of impulses that were blocked at the time of the trauma (e.g. the impulse to run or push away).</p>
<p>For many people with PTSD induced relaxation (e.g. relaxation exercises) will precipitate a trauma reaction, increasing hyperarousal and anxiety, risking flashbacks. For such people, building or maintaining muscle tension is preferable to relaxation. For many people, muscle tensing helps reduce unpleasant body sensations attached to the trauma - even to the point of enabling sleep.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This is not about aerobic exercise as elevated heart and respiration rates can be trauma triggers</em>. Rather, it is slow, focussed, muscle building exercise that is beneficial. To be effective it must be done with body awareness - with attention given to body sensations generally and to the muscles being exercised specifically. Also, the exercise must stop at the point of mild tiredness in the muscle, while it is still a pleasant experience. Developing muscle tone increases self-confidence and reduces feelings of vulnerability and hyperarousal. Muscle tensing can be used as an emergency measure when anxiety threatens to escalate into overwhelm or panic. Exercises that enhance sensations of calm, solidity and increased presence are beneficial. The idea is to build a positive experience of being in the body by developing musculature that can better contain hyperarousal and the full range of the emotions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>• <strong>Push-ups:</strong> these help build tone in the arms, chest and back. Begin by standing a few feet from a wall, leaning into it and pushing away. Gradually move lower and lower on the wall until there is enough strength to push up from stairs or the floor</em></p>
<p><em>.• <strong>Thighs:</strong> Sitting in a chair, place both feet flat on the floor. Press weight onto your feet just until you feel tension build in your thighs, then slowly release.</em></p>
<p><em>• <strong>Leg lifts</strong> in many directions also need no special equipment. Simple weights such as milk cartons, books, water bottles can be used for strengthening the front of the upper arms.</em></p>

<li><strong>Strategies For Self-Soothing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Self-soothing activities are a source of decreased arousal, pleasurable sensations and calming feelings. They are characterised by: slow, gentle or rhythmical movements; softness in texture, tone and hues; quietness in volume. They include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>• Calming breathing</p>
<p>• Gentle holding and rocking</p>
<p>• Calming self-talk</p>
<p>• Accessing calming sensations: e.g. warm baths and showers, warm drinks, soft textiles (blankets, bedsocks, soft toys, hot water bottles), calming music, soft lighting walking, gardening or swimming.</p>
