<p>&nbsp;</p>      <h1 class="chapterauthor"><a href="intro.html#marcus-adam">Adam Marcus</a></h1>
    </div>

<p>Unlike most of the other projects in this book, NoSQL is not a tool, but
an ecosystem composed of several complimentary and competing tools.
The tools branded with the NoSQL monicker provide an alternative to
SQL-based relational database systems for storing data. To understand
NoSQL, we have to understand the space of available tools, and see how
the design of each one explores the space of data storage possibilities.</p>

<p>If you are considering using a NoSQL storage system, you should first
understand the wide space of options that NoSQL systems span.  NoSQL
systems do away with many of the traditional comforts of relational
database systems, and operations which were typically encapsulated
behind the system boundary of a database are now left to application
designers.  This requires you to take on the hat of a systems
architect, which requires a more in-depth understanding of how such
systems are built.</p>

<div class="sect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>13.1. What's in a Name?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In defining the space of NoSQL, let's first take a stab at defining
the name.  Taken literally, a NoSQL system presents a query interface
to the user that is not SQL.  The NoSQL community generally takes a
more inclusive view, suggesting that NoSQL systems provide
alternatives to traditional relational databases, and allow developers
to design projects which use <em>Not Only</em> a SQL interface. In some
cases, you might replace a relational database with a NoSQL
alternative, and in others you will employ a mix-and-match approach to
different problems you encounter in application development.</p>

<p>Before diving into the world of NoSQL, let's explore the cases where
SQL and the relational model suit your needs, and others where a NoSQL
system might be a better fit.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.1.1. SQL and the Relational Model</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SQL is a declarative language for querying data.  A declarative
language is one in which a programmer specifies <em>what</em> they want
the system to do, rather than procedurally defining <em>how</em> the
system should do it.  A few examples include: find the record for
employee 39, project out only the employee name and phone number from
their entire record, filter employee records to those that work in
accounting, count the employees in each department, or join the data
from the employees table with the managers table.</p>

<p>To a first approximation, SQL allows you to ask these questions without
thinking about how the data is laid out on disk, which indices to use
to access the data, or what algorithms to use to process the data.  A
significant architectural component of most relational databases is a
<em>query optimizer</em>, which decides which of the many logically
equivalent query plans to execute to most quickly answer a query.
These optimizers are often better than the average database user, but
sometimes they do not have enough information or have too simple a
model of the system in order to generate the most efficient execution.</p>

<p>Relational databases, which are the most common databases used in
practice, follow the <em>relational data model</em>.  In this model, different
real-world entities are stored in different tables.  For example, all
employees might be stored in an Employees table, and all departments
might be stored in a Departments table.  Each row of a table has
various properties stored in columns.  For example, employees might
have an employee id, salary, birth date, and first/last names.  Each of these properties
will be stored in a column of the Employees table.</p>

<p>The relational model goes hand-in-hand with SQL.  Simple SQL queries,
such as filters, retrieve all records whose field matches some test
(e.g., employeeid&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, or salary&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;$20000).  More complex constructs
cause the database to do some extra work, such as joining data from
multiple tables (e.g., what is the name of the department in which
employee 3 works?).  Other complex constructs such as aggregates
(e.g., what is the average salary of my employees?) can lead to
full-table scans.</p>

<p>The relational data model defines highly structured entities with
strict relationships between them.  Querying this model with SQL
allows complex data traversals without too much custom development.
The complexity of such modeling and querying has its limits, though:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Complexity leads to unpredictability.  SQL's expressiveness
  makes it challenging to reason about the cost of each query, and thus the
  cost of a workload.  While simpler query languages might complicate
  application logic, they make it easier to provision data storage
  systems, which only respond to simple requests.</li>

  <li>There are many ways to model a problem.  The relational data
  model is strict: the schema assigned to each table specifies the
  data in each row.  If we are storing less structured data, or rows
  with more variance in the columns they store, the relational model
  may be needlessly restrictive.  Similarly, application developers
  might not find the relational model perfect for modeling every kind
  of data.  For example, a lot of application logic is written in
  object-oriented languages and includes high-level concepts such as
  lists, queues, and sets, and some programmers would like their
  persistence layer to model this.</li>

  <li>If the data grows past the capacity of one server, then the
  tables in the database will have to be partitioned across computers.
  To avoid JOINs having to cross the network in order to get data in
  different tables, we will have to denormalize it.  Denormalization
  stores all of the data from different tables that one might want to
  look up at once in a single place.  This makes our database look
  like a key-lookup storage system, leaving us wondering what other
  data models might better suit the data.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's generally not wise to discard many years of design considerations
arbitrarily.  When you consider storing your data in a database,
consider SQL and the relational model, which are backed by decades of
research and development, offer rich modeling capabilities, and
provide easy-to-understand guarantees about complex operations.  NoSQL
is a good option when you have a specific problem, such as large
amounts of data, a massive workload, or a difficult data modeling
decision for which SQL and relational databases might not have been
optimized.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.1.2. NoSQL Inspirations</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NoSQL movement finds much of its inspiration in papers from the
research community.  While many papers are at the core of design
decisions in NoSQL systems, two stand out in particular.</p>

<p>Google's BigTable [<a href="bibliography.html#bib:bigtable">CDG+06</a>]
presents an interesting data model,
which facilitates sorted storage of multi-column historical data.
Data is distributed to multiple servers using a hierarchical
range-based partitioning scheme, and data is updated with strict
consistency (a concept that we will eventually define in
<a href="#sec.nosql.consistency">Section&nbsp;13.5</a>).</p>

<p>Amazon's Dynamo [<a href="bibliography.html#bib:amazon:dynamo">DHJ+07</a>]
uses a different key-oriented distributed datastore.
Dynamo's data model is simpler, mapping keys to application-specific
blobs of data.  The partitioning model is more resilient to failure,
but accomplishes that goal through a looser data consistency approach
called eventual consistency.</p>

<p>We will dig into each of these concepts in more detail, but it is
important to understand that many of them can be mixed and matched.
Some NoSQL systems such as HBase<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> sticks closely to the BigTable
design. Another NoSQL system named Voldemort<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> replicates many of
Dynamo's features.  Still other NoSQL projects such as Cassandra<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> have
taken some features from BigTable (its data model) and others from
Dynamo (its partitioning and consistency schemes).</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.1.3. Characteristics and Considerations</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NoSQL systems part ways with the hefty SQL standard and offer simpler
but piecemeal solutions for architecting storage solutions.  These
systems were built with the belief that in simplifying how a database
operates over data, an architect can better predict the performance of
a query.  In many NoSQL systems, complex query logic is left to the
application, resulting in a data store with more predictable query
performance because of the lack of variability in queries</p>

<p>NoSQL systems part with more than just declarative queries over the
relational data.  Transactional semantics, consistency, and durability
are guarantees that organizations such as banks demand of databases.
<em>Transactions</em> provide an all-or-nothing guarantee when combining
several potentially complex operations into one, such as deducting
money from one account and adding the money to another.  <em>Consistency</em>
ensures that when a value is updated, subsequent queries will see the
updated value.  <em>Durability</em> guarantees that once a value is updated, it
will be written to stable storage (such as a hard drive) and
recoverable if the database crashes.</p>

<p>NoSQL systems relax some of these guarantees, a decision which, for
many non-banking applications, can provide acceptable and predictable
behavior in exchange for improved performance.  These relaxations,
combined with data model and query language changes, often make it
easier to safely partition a database across multiple machines when
the data grows beyond a single machine's capability.</p>

<p>NoSQL systems are still very much in their infancy.  The architectural
decisions that go into the systems described in this chapter are a
testament to the requirements of various users.  The biggest
challenge in summarizing the architectural features of several open
source projects is that each one is a moving target.  Keep in mind
that the details of individual systems will change. When you pick
between NoSQL systems, you can use this chapter to guide your thought
process, but not your feature-by-feature product selection.</p>

<p class="continue">As you think about NoSQL systems, here is a roadmap of considerations:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Data and query model</em>: Is your data represented as rows,
  objects, data structures, or documents? Can you ask the database to
  calculate aggregates over multiple records?</li>

  <li><em>Durability</em>: When you change a value, does it immediately
  go to stable storage?  Does it get stored on multiple machines in
  case one crashes?</li>

  <li><em>Scalability</em>: Does your data fit on a single server?  Do
  the amount of reads and writes require multiple disks to handle the
  workload?</li>

  <li><em>Partitioning</em>: For scalability, availability, or
  durability reasons, does the data need to live on multiple servers?
  How do you know which record is on which server?</li>

  <li><em>Consistency</em>: If you've partitioned and replicated your
  records across multiple servers, how do the servers coordinate when
  a record changes?</li>

  <li><em>Transactional semantics</em>: When you run a series of
  operations, some databases allow you to wrap them in a transaction,
  which provides some subset of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency,
  Isolation, and Durability) guarantees on the transaction and all
  others currently running.  Does your business logic require these
  guarantees, which often come with performance tradeoffs?</li>

  <li><em>Single-server performance</em>: If you want to safely store
  data on disk, what on-disk data structures are best-geared toward
  read-heavy or write-heavy workloads? Is writing to disk your
  bottleneck?</li>

  <li><em>Analytical workloads</em>: We're going to pay a lot of
  attention to lookup-heavy workloads of the kind you need to run a
  responsive user-focused web application.  In many cases, you will
  want to build dataset-sized reports, aggregating statistics across
  multiple users for example.  Does your use-case and toolchain
  require such functionality?</li>

</ul>

<p>While we will touch on all of these consideration, the last three, 
while equally important, see the least attention in this chapter.</p>

<div class="sect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>13.2. NoSQL Data and Query Models</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>data model</em> of a database specifies how data is logically
organized.  Its <em>query model</em> dictates how the data can be
retrieved and updated.  Common data models are the relational model,
key-oriented storage model, or various graph models.  Query languages
you might have heard of include SQL, key lookups, and MapReduce.
NoSQL systems combine different data and query models, resulting in
different architectural considerations.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.2.1. Key-based NoSQL Data Models</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NoSQL systems often part with the relational model and the full
expressivity of SQL by restricting lookups on a dataset to a single
field.  For example, even if an employee has many properties, you
might only be able to retrieve an employee by her ID.  As a result,
most queries in NoSQL systems are key lookup-based.  The programmer
selects a key to identify each data item, and can, for the most part,
only retrieve items by performing a lookup for their key in the
database.</p>

<p>In key lookup-based systems, complex join operations or multiple-key
retrieval of the same data might require creative uses of key names.
A programmer wishing to look up an employee by his
employee ID and to look up all employees in a department might create
two key types.  For example, the key <font size=1><code>employee:30</code></font> would point to an employee
record for employee ID 30, and <font size=1><code>employee_departments:20</code></font> might
contain a list of all employees in department 20.  A join operation
gets pushed into application logic: to retrieve employees in
department 20, an application first retrieves a list of employee IDs
from key <font size=1><code>employee_departments:20</code></font>, and then loops over key
lookups for each <font size=1><code>employee:ID</code></font> in the employee list.</p>

<p>The key lookup model is beneficial because it means that the database
has a consistent query pattern&#8212;the entire workload consists of key
lookups whose performance is relatively uniform and predictable.
Profiling to find the slow parts of an application is simpler, since
all complex operations reside in the application code.  On the flip
side, the data model logic and business logic are now more closely
intertwined, which muddles abstraction.</p>

<p>Let's quickly touch on the data associated with each key.  Various
NoSQL systems offer different solutions in this space.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Key-Value Stores</h4>

<p>The simplest form of NoSQL store is a <em>key-value</em> store.  Each
key is mapped to a value containing arbitrary data.  The NoSQL store
has no knowledge of the contents of its payload, and simply delivers
the data to the application.  In our Employee database example, one
might map the key <font size=1><code>employee:30</code></font> to a blob containing JSON or a
binary format such as Protocol
Buffers<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>,
Thrift<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>, or
Avro<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> in order to encapsulate
the information about employee 30.</p>

<p>If a developer uses structured formats to store complex data for a
key, she must operate against the data in application space: a
key-value data store generally offers no mechanisms for querying for
keys based on some property of their values.  Key-value stores shine
in the simplicity of their query model, usually consisting of
<font size=1><code>set</code></font>, <font size=1><code>get</code></font>, and <font size=1><code>delete</code></font> primitives, but discard the
ability to add simple in-database filtering capabilities due to the
opacity of their values.  Voldemort, which is based on Amazon's
Dynamo, provides a distributed key-value store.  BDB<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> offers a
persistence library that has a key-value interface.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Key-Data Structure Stores</h4>

<p>Key-data structure stores, made popular by Redis<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>, assign each value a
type.  In Redis, the available types a value can take on are integer,
string, list, set, and sorted set.  In addition to
<font size=1><code>set</code></font>/<font size=1><code>get</code></font>/<font size=1><code>delete</code></font>, type-specific commands, such as
increment/decrement for integers, or push/pop for lists, add
functionality to the query model without drastically affecting
performance characteristics of requests.  By providing simple
type-specific functionality while avoiding multi-key operations such as
aggregation or joins, Redis balances functionality and performance.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Key-Document Stores</h4>

<p>Key-document stores, such as CouchDB<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>, MongoDB<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>, and Riak<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>, map a key to
some document that contains structured information.  These systems
store documents in a JSON or JSON-like format.  They store lists and
dictionaries, which can be embedded recursively inside one-another.</p>

<p>MongoDB separates the keyspace into collections, so that keys for
Employees and Department, for example, do not collide.  CouchDB and
Riak leave type-tracking to the developer.  The freedom and complexity
of document stores is a double-edged sword: application developers
have a lot of freedom in modeling their documents, but
application-based query logic can become exceedingly complex.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>BigTable Column Family Stores</h4>

<p>HBase and Cassandra base their data model on the one used by Google's
BigTable.  In this model, a key identifies a row, which contains data
stored in one or more Column Families (CFs).  Within a CF, each row
can contain multiple columns.  The values within each column are
timestamped, so that several versions of a row-column mapping can live
within a CF.</p>

<p>Conceptually, one can think of Column Families as storing complex keys
of the form (row ID, CF, column, timestamp), mapping to values which
are sorted by their keys.  This design results in data modeling
decisions which push a lot of functionality into the keyspace.  It is
particularly good at modeling historical data with timestamps.  The
model naturally supports sparse column placement since row IDs that do
not have certain columns do not need an explicit NULL value for those
columns.  On the flip side, columns which have few or no NULL values
must still store the column identifier with each row, which leads to
greater space consumption.</p>

<p>Each project data model differs from the original BigTable model in
various ways, but Cassandra's changes are most notable.  Cassandra
introduces the notion of a supercolumn within each CF to allow for
another level of mapping, modeling, and indexing.  It also does away
with a notion of locality groups, which can physically store multiple
column families together for performance reasons.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.2.2. Graph Storage</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One class of NoSQL stores are graph stores.  Not all data is created
equal, and the relational and key-oriented data models of storing and
querying data are not the best for all data.  Graphs are a fundamental
data structure in computer science, and systems such as HyperGraphDB<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup>
and Neo4J<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> are two popular NoSQL storage systems for storing
graph-structured data.  Graph stores differ from the other stores we
have discussed thus far in almost every way: data models, data
traversal and querying patterns, physical layout of data on disk,
distribution to multiple machines, and the transactional semantics of
queries.  We can not do these stark differences justice given space
limitations, but you should be aware that certain classes of data may
be better stored and queried as a graph.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.2.3. Complex Queries</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are notable exceptions to key-only lookups in NoSQL systems.
MongoDB allows you to index your data based on any number of
properties and has a relatively high-level language for specifying
which data you want to retrieve.  BigTable-based systems support
scanners to iterate over a column family and select particular items by a
filter on a column.  CouchDB allows you to create different views of
the data, and to run MapReduce tasks across your table to facilitate
more complex lookups and updates.  Most of the systems have bindings
to Hadoop or another MapReduce framework to perform dataset-scale
analytical queries.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.2.4. Transactions</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NoSQL systems generally prioritize performance over
<em>transactional semantics</em>.  Other SQL-based systems allow any set
of statements&#8212;from a simple primary key row retrieval, to a
complicated join between several tables which is then subsequently
averaged across several fields&#8212;to be placed in a transaction.</p>

<p>These SQL databases will offer ACID guarantees between transactions.
Running multiple operations in a transaction is Atomic (the A in
ACID), meaning all or none of the operations happen.  Consistency (the
C) ensures that the transaction leaves the database in a consistent,
uncorrupted state.  Isolation (the I) makes sure that if two
transactions touch the same record, they will do without stepping on
each other's feet.  Durability (the D, covered extensively in the next
section), ensures that once a transaction is committed, it's stored in
a safe place.</p>

<p>ACID-compliant transactions keep developers sane by making it easy to
reason about the state of their data.  Imagine multiple
transactions, each of which has multiple steps (e.g., first check the
value of a bank account, then subtract $60, then update the
value). ACID-compliant databases often are limited in how they can
interleave these steps while still providing a correct result across
all transactions.  This push for correctness results in
often-unexpected performance characteristics, where a slow transaction
might cause an otherwise quick one to wait in line.</p>

<p>Most NoSQL systems pick performance over full ACID guarantees, but do
provide guarantees at the key level: two operations on the same key
will be serialized, avoiding serious corruption to key-value pairs.
For many applications, this decision will not pose noticeable
correctness issues, and will allow quick operations to execute with
more regularity.  It does, however, leave more considerations for
application design and correctness in the hands of the developer.</p>

<p>Redis is the notable exception to the no-transaction trend.  On a
single server, it provides a <font size=1><code>MULTI</code></font> command to combine multiple
operations atomically and consistently, and a <font size=1><code>WATCH</code></font> command to
allow isolation.  Other systems provide lower-level
<em>test-and-set</em> functionality which provides some isolation
guarantees.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.2.5. Schema-free Storage </h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cross-cutting property of many NoSQL systems is the lack of schema
enforcement in the database.  Even in document stores and column
family-oriented stores, properties across similar entities are not
required to be the same.  This has the benefit of supporting less
structured data requirements and requiring less performance expense
when modifying schemas on-the-fly.  The decision leaves more
responsibility to the application developer, who now has to program
more defensively.  For example, is the lack of a <font size=1><code>lastname</code></font>
property on an employee record an error to be rectified, or a schema
update which is currently propagating through the system?  Data and
schema versioning is common in application-level code after a few
iterations of a project which relies on <em>sloppy-schema</em> NoSQL
systems.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>13.3. Data Durability</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, all data modifications on a storage system would immediately
be safely persisted and replicated to multiple locations to avoid data
loss.  However, ensuring data safety is in tension with performance,
and different NoSQL systems make different <em>data durability</em>
guarantees in order to improve performance.  Failure scenarios are
varied and numerous, and not all NoSQL systems protect you against
these issues.</p>

<p>A simple and common failure scenario is a server restart or power
loss.  Data durability in this case involves having moved the data
from memory to a hard disk, which does not require power to store
data.  Hard disk failure is handled by copying the data to secondary
devices, be they other hard drives in the same machine (RAID
mirroring) or other machines on the network.  However, a data center
might not survive an event which causes correlated failure (a tornado, for example), and some
organizations go so far as to copy data to backups in data centers
several hurricane widths apart. Writing to hard drives and copying
data to multiple servers or data centers is expensive, so different
NoSQL systems trade off durability guarantees for performance.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.3.1. Single-server Durability</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The simplest form of durability is a <em>single-server durability</em>,
which ensures that any data modification will survive a server restart
or power loss.  This usually means writing the changed data to disk,
which often bottlenecks your workload.  Even if you order your
operating system to write data to an on-disk file, the operating
system may buffer the write, avoiding an immediate modification on
disk so that it can group several writes together into a single
operation.  Only when the <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> system call is issued does the
operating system make a best-effort attempt to ensure that buffered
updates are persisted to disk.</p>

<p>Typical hard drives can perform 100-200 random accesses (seeks) per
second, and are limited to 30-100 MB/sec of sequential writes.  Memory 
can be orders of magnitudes faster in both scenarios.  Ensuring
efficient single-server durability means limiting the number of random
writes your system incurs, and increasing the number of sequential
writes per hard drive. Ideally, you want a system to minimize the
number of writes between <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> calls, maximizing the number of
those writes that are sequential, all the while never telling the user
their data has been successfully written to disk until that write has
been <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font>ed.  Let's cover a few techniques for improving
performance of single-server durability guarantees.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Control <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> Frequency</h4>

<p>Memcached<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup> is an example of a system which offers no on-disk durability
in exchange for extremely fast in-memory operations.  When a server
restarts, the data on that server is gone: this makes for a good cache
and a poor durable data store.</p>

<p>Redis offers developers several options for when to call
<font size=1><code>fsync</code></font>. Developers can force an <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> call after every
update, which is the slow and safe choice.  For better performance,
Redis can <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> its writes every N seconds.  In a worst-case
scenario, the you will lose last N seconds worth of operations, which
may be acceptable for certain uses.  Finally, for use cases where
durability is not important (maintaining coarse-grained statistics, or
using Redis as a cache), the developer can turn off <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> calls
entirely: the operating system will eventually flush the data to disk,
but without guarantees of when this will happen.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Increase Sequential Writes by Logging</h4>

<p>Several data structures, such as B+Trees, help NoSQL systems quickly
retrieve data from disk.  Updates to those structures result in
updates in random locations in the data structures' files, resulting
in several random writes per update if you <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> after each
update.  To reduce random writes, systems such as Cassandra, HBase,
Redis, and Riak append update operations to a sequentially-written
file called a <em>log</em>.  While other data structures used by the
system are only periodically <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font>ed, the log is frequently
<font size=1><code>fsync</code></font>ed.  By treating the log as the ground-truth state of the
database after a crash, these storage engines are able to turn random
updates into sequential ones.</p>

<p>While NoSQL systems such as MongoDB perform writes in-place in their
data structures, others take logging even further.  Cassandra and
HBase use a technique borrowed from BigTable of combining their logs
and lookup data structures into one <em>log-structured merge tree</em>.
Riak provides similar functionality with a <em>log-structured hash
table</em>.  CouchDB has modified the traditional B+Tree so that all
changes to the data structure are appended to the structure on
physical storage.  These techniques result in improved write
throughput, but require a periodic log compaction to keep the log from
growing unbounded.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Increase Throughput by Grouping Writes</h4>

<p>Cassandra groups multiple concurrent updates within a short window
into a single <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> call.  This design, called <em>group
commit</em>, results in higher latency per update, as users have to wait
on several concurrent updates to have their own update be
acknowledged.  The latency bump comes at an increase in throughput, as
multiple log appends can happen with a single <font size=1><code>fsync</code></font>.  As of
this writing, every HBase update is persisted to the underlying
storage provided by the Hadoop Distributed File System
(HDFS)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup>, which has
recently seen patches to allow support of appends that respect
<font size=1><code>fsync</code></font> and group commit.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.3.2. Multi-server Durability</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because hard drives and machines often irreparably fail, copying
important data across machines is necessary.  Many NoSQL systems offer
multi-server durability for data.</p>

<p>Redis takes a traditional master-slave approach to replicating data.
All operations executed against a master are communicated in a
log-like fashion to slave machines, which replicate the operations on
their own hardware.  If a master fails, a slave can step in and serve
the data from the state of the operation log that it received from the
master.  This configuration might result in some data loss, as the
master does not confirm that the slave has persisted an operation in
its log before acknowledging the operation to the user.  CouchDB
facilitates a similar form of directional replication, where servers
can be configured to replicate changes to documents on other stores.</p>

<p>MongoDB provides the notion of replica sets, where some number of
servers are responsible for storing each document.  MongoDB gives
developers the option of ensuring that all replicas have received
updates, or to proceed without ensuring that replicas have the most
recent data.  Many of the other distributed NoSQL storage systems
support multi-server replication of data.  HBase, which is built on
top of HDFS, receives multi-server durability through HDFS.  All
writes are replicated to two or more HDFS nodes before returning
control to the user, ensuring multi-server durability.</p>

<p>Riak, Cassandra, and Voldemort support more configurable forms of
replication.  With subtle differences, all three systems allow the
user to specify <font size=1><code>N</code></font>, the number of machines which should
ultimately have a copy of the data, and <font size=1><code>W</code></font>&lt;<font size=1><code>N</code></font>,
the number of machines that should confirm the data has been written
before returning control to the user.</p>

<p>To handle cases where an entire data center goes out of service,
multi-server replication across data centers is required.  Cassandra,
HBase, and Voldemort have <em>rack-aware</em> configurations, which
specify the rack or data center in which various machines are located.
In general, blocking the user's request until a remote server has
acknowledged an update incurs too much latency. Updates are streamed
without confirmation when performed across wide area networks to
backup data centers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>13.4. Scaling for Performance</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having just spoken about handling failure, let's imagine a rosier
situation: success!  If the system you build reaches success, your
data store will be one of the components to feel stress under load.  A
cheap and dirty solution to such problems is to <em>scale up</em> your
existing machinery: invest in more RAM and disks to handle the
workload on one machine.  With more success, pouring money into more
expensive hardware will become infeasible.  At this point, you will
have to replicate data and spread requests across multiple machines to
distribute load.  This approach is called <em>scale out</em>, and is
measured by the <em>horizontal scalability</em> of your system.</p>

<p>The ideal horizontal scalability goal is <em>linear scalability</em>, in
which doubling the number of machines in your storage system doubles
the query capacity of the system.  The key to such scalability is in
how the data is spread across machines.  Sharding is the act of
splitting your read and write workload across multiple machines to
scale out your storage system.  Sharding is fundamental to the design
of many systems, namely Cassandra, HBase, Voldemort, and Riak, and
more recently MongoDB and Redis.  Some projects such as CouchDB focus
on single-server performance and do not provide an in-system solution
to sharding, but secondary projects provide coordinators to partition
the workload across independent installations on multiple machines.</p>

<p>Let's cover a few interchangeable terms you might encounter.  We will
use the terms <em>sharding</em> and <em>partitioning</em> interchangeably.
The terms <em>machine</em>, <em>server</em>, or <em>node</em> refer to some
physical computer which stores part of the partitioned data.  Finally,
a <em>cluster</em> or <em>ring</em> refers to the set of machines which
participate in your storage system.</p>

<p>Sharding means that no one machine has to handle the write workload on
the entire dataset, but no one machine can answer queries about the
entire dataset.  Most NoSQL systems are key-oriented in both their
data and query models, and few queries touch the entire dataset
anyway.  Because the primary access method for data in these systems
is key-based, sharding is typically key-based as well: some function
of the key determines the machine on which a key-value pair is
stored.  We'll cover two methods of defining the key-machine mapping:
hash partitioning and range partitioning.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.4.1. Do Not Shard Until You Have To</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharding adds system complexity, and where possible, you should avoid
it.  Let's cover two ways to scale without sharding: read replicas and
caching.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Read Replicas</h4>

<p>Many storage systems see more read requests than write requests.  A
simple solution in these cases is to make copies of the data on
multiple machines.  All write requests still go to a master node.
Read requests go to machines which replicate the data, and are often
slightly stale with respect to the data on the write master.</p>

<p>If you are already replicating your data for multi-server durability
in a master-slave configuration, as is common in Redis, CouchDB, or
MongoDB, the read slaves can shed some load from the write master.
Some queries, such as aggregate summaries of your dataset, which might
be expensive and often do not require up-to-the-second freshness, can
be executed against the slave replicas.  Generally, the less stringent
your demands for freshness of content, the more you can lean on read
slaves to improve read-only query performance.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Caching</h4>

<p>Caching the most popular content in your system often works
surprisingly well.  Memcached dedicates blocks of memory on multiple
servers to cache data from your data store.  Memcached clients take
advantage of several horizontal scalability tricks to distribute load
across Memcached installations on different servers.  To add memory to
the cache pool, just add another Memcached host.</p>

<p>Because Memcached is designed for caching, it does not have as much
architectural complexity as the persistent solutions for scaling
workloads.  Before considering more complicated solutions, think about
whether caching can solve your scalability woes.  Caching is not solely
a temporary band-aid: Facebook has Memcached installations in the range
of tens of terabytes of memory!</p>

</div>

<p>Read replicas and caching allow you to scale up your read-heavy
workloads.  When you start to increase the frequency of writes and
updates to your data, however, you will also increase the load on the
master server that contains all of your up-to-date data.  For the rest
of this section, we will cover techniques for sharding your write
workload across multiple servers.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.4.2. Sharding Through Coordinators</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CouchDB project focuses on the single-server experience.  Two
projects, Lounge and BigCouch, facilitate sharding CouchDB workloads
through an external proxy, which acts as a front end to standalone
CouchDB instances.  In this design, the standalone installations are
not aware of each other.  The coordinator distributes requests to
individual CouchDB instances based on the key of the document being
requested.</p>

<p>Twitter has built the notions of sharding and replication into a
coordinating framework called Gizzard<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup>.  Gizzard takes standalone data stores of any
type&#8212;you can build wrappers for SQL or NoSQL storage systems&#8212;and
arranges them in trees of any depth to partition keys by key range.
For fault tolerance, Gizzard can be configured to replicate data to
multiple physical machines for the same key range.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.4.3. Consistent Hash Rings</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good hash functions distribute a set of keys in a uniform manner.
This makes them a powerful tool for distributing key-value pairs
among multiple servers.  The academic literature on a technique
called <em>consistent hashing</em> is extensive, and the first
applications of the technique to data stores was in systems called
<em>distributed hash tables</em> (<em>DHTs</em>).  NoSQL systems built
around the principles of Amazon's Dynamo adopted this distribution
technique, and it appears in Cassandra, Voldemort, and Riak.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Hash Rings by Example</h4>

<div class="figure" id="fig.nosql.hashring">
  <img src="fig_13_1_hashring.png" alt="[A Distributed Hash Table Ring]">
<em><p>Figure&nbsp;13.1: A Distributed Hash Table Ring</p></em><p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>Consistent hash rings work as follows.  Say we have a hash function
<font size=1><code>H</code></font> that maps keys to uniformly distributed large integer values.  We
can form a ring of numbers in the range [1, L] that wraps around
itself with these values by taking H(key) mod L for some relatively
large integer L.  This will map each key into the range [1,L].  A
consistent hash ring of servers is formed by taking each server's
unique identifier (say its IP address), and applying H to it.  You can
get an intuition for how this works by looking at the hash ring formed
by five servers (<font size=1><code>A</code></font>-<font size=1><code>E</code></font>) in <a href="#fig.nosql.hashring">Figure&nbsp;13.1</a>.</p>

<p>There, we picked <font size=1><code>L = 1000</code></font>.  Let's say that <font size=1><code>H(A) mod
L = 7</code></font>, <font size=1><code>H(B) mod L = 234</code></font>, <font size=1><code>H(C) mod L = 447</code></font>, <font size=1><code>H(D)
mod L = 660</code></font>, and <font size=1><code>H(E) mod L = 875</code></font>.  We can now tell which
server a key should live on.  To do this, we map all keys to a server
by seeing if it falls in the range between that server and the next
one in the ring.  For example, <font size=1><code>A</code></font> is responsible for keys whose
hash value falls in the range [7,233], and <font size=1><code>E</code></font> is responsible for
keys in the range [875, 6] (this range wraps around on itself at
1000).  So if <font size=1><code>H('employee30') mod L = 899</code></font>, it will be stored by
server <font size=1><code>E</code></font>, and if <font size=1><code>H('employee31') mod L = 234</code></font>, it will be
stored on server <font size=1><code>B</code></font>.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Replicating Data</h4>

<p>Replication for multi-server durability is achieved by passing the
keys and values in one server's assigned range to the servers
following it in the ring.  For example, with a replication factor of
3, keys mapped to the range [7,233] will be stored on servers
<font size=1><code>A</code></font>, <font size=1><code>B</code></font>, and <font size=1><code>C</code></font>.  If <font size=1><code>A</code></font> were to fail, its
neighbors <font size=1><code>B</code></font> and <font size=1><code>C</code></font> would take over its workload.  In some designs,
<font size=1><code>E</code></font> would replicate and take over <font size=1><code>A</code></font>'s workload temporarily,
since its range would expand to include <font size=1><code>A</code></font>'s.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Achieving Better Distribution</h4>

<p>While hashing is statistically effective at uniformly distributing a
keyspace, it usually requires many servers before it distributes
evenly.  Unfortunately, we often start with a small number of servers
that are not perfectly spaced apart from one-another by the hash
function.  In our example, <font size=1><code>A</code></font>'s key range is of length 227,
whereas <font size=1><code>E</code></font>'s range is 132.  This leads to uneven load on
different servers.  It also makes it difficult for servers to take
over for one-another when they fail, since a neighbor suddenly has to
take control of the entire range of the failed server.</p>

<p>To solve the problem of uneven large key ranges, many DHTs including
Riak create several `virtual' nodes per physical machine.  For
example, with 4 virtual nodes, server <font size=1><code>A</code></font> will act as server
<font size=1><code>A_1</code></font>, <font size=1><code>A_2</code></font>, <font size=1><code>A_3</code></font>, and <font size=1><code>A_4</code></font>.  Each virtual
node hashes to a different value, giving it more opportunity to manage
keys distributed to different parts of the keyspace.  Voldemort takes
a similar approach, in which the number of partitions is manually
configured and usually larger than the number of servers, resulting in
each server receiving a number of smaller partitions.</p>

<p>Cassandra does not assign multiple small partitions to each server,
resulting in sometimes uneven key range distributions.  For
load-balancing, Cassandra has an asynchronous process which adjusts
the location of servers on the ring depending on their historic load.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.4.4. Range Partitioning</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the range partitioning approach to sharding, some machines in your
system keep metadata about which servers contain which key ranges.
This metadata is consulted to route key and range lookups to the
appropriate servers.  Like the consistent hash ring approach, this
range partitioning splits the keyspace into ranges, with each key
range being managed by one machine and potentially replicated to
others.  Unlike the consistent hashing approach, two keys that are
next to each other in the key's sort order are likely to appear in the
same partition.  This reduces the size of the routing metadata, as
large ranges are compressed to [start, end] markers.</p>

<p>In adding active record-keeping of the <em>range-to-server</em> mapping,
the range partitioning approach allows for more fine-grained control
of load-shedding from heavily loaded servers.  If a specific key range
sees higher traffic than other ranges, a load manager can reduce the
size of the range on that server, or reduce the number of shards that
this server serves.  The added freedom to actively manage load comes
at the expense of extra architectural components which monitor and
route shards.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>The BigTable Way</h4>

<p>Google's BigTable paper describes a range-partitioning hierarchical
technique for sharding data into tablets.  A tablet stores a range of
row keys and values within a column family.  It maintains all
of the necessary logs and data structures to answer queries about the
keys in its assigned range.  Tablet servers serve multiple tablets
depending on the load each tablet is experiencing.</p>

<p>Each tablet is kept at a size of 100-200 MB.  As tablets change in size, two
small tablets with adjoining key ranges might be combined, or a large tablet might be
split in two.  A master server analyzes tablet size,
load, and tablet server availability.  The master adjusts which tablet
server serves which tablets at any time.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.nosql.bigtable">
  <img src="fig_13_2_bigtable.png" alt="[BigTable-based Range Partitioning]">
<em><p>Figure&nbsp;13.2: BigTable-based Range Partitioning</p></em><p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>The master server maintains the tablet assignment in a metadata table.
Because this metadata can get large, the metadata table is also
sharded into tablets that map key ranges to tablets and tablet servers
responsible for those ranges.  This results in a three-layer hierarchy
traversal for clients to find a key on its hosting tablet server,
as depicted in <a href="#fig.nosql.bigtable">Figure&nbsp;13.2</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at an example.  A client searching for key
<font size=1><code>900</code></font> will query server <font size=1><code>A</code></font>, which stores the tablet for
metadata level 0.  This tablet identifies the metadata level 1 tablet
on server 6 containing key ranges 500-1500.  The client sends a
request to server <font size=1><code>B</code></font> with this key, which responds that the
tablet containing keys 850-950 is found on a tablet on server
C.  Finally, the client sends the key request to server <font size=1><code>C</code></font>, and
gets the row data back for its query.  Metadata tablets at level 0 and
1 may be cached by the client, which avoids putting undue load on
their tablet servers from repeat queries.  The BigTable paper explains
that this 3-level hierarchy can accommodate 2<sup>61</sup> bytes worth of storage
using 128MB tablets.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Handling Failures</h4>

<p>The master is a single point of failure in the BigTable design, but
can go down temporarily without affecting requests to tablet servers.
If a tablet server fails while serving tablet requests, it is up to
the master to recognize this and re-assign its tablets while requests
temporarily fail.</p>

<p>In order to recognize and handle machine failures, the BigTable paper
describes the use of Chubby, a distributed locking system for managing
server membership and liveness.
ZooKeeper<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> is the
open source implementation of Chubby, and several Hadoop-based
projects utilize it to manage secondary master servers and tablet
server reassignment.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Range Partitioning-based NoSQL Projects</h4>

<p>HBase employs BigTable's hierarchical approach to range-partitioning.
Underlying tablet data is stored in Hadoop's distributed filesystem
(HDFS).  HDFS handles data replication and consistency among replicas,
leaving tablet servers to handle requests, update storage structures,
and initiate tablet splits and compactions.</p>

<p>MongoDB handles range partitioning in a manner similar to that of
BigTable.  Several configuration nodes store and manage the routing
tables that specify which storage node is responsible for which key
ranges.  These configuration nodes stay in sync through a protocol
called <em>two-phase commit</em>, and serve as a hybrid of BigTable's
master for specifying ranges and Chubby for highly available
configuration management.  Separate routing processes, which are
stateless, keep track of the most recent routing configuration and
route key requests to the appropriate storage nodes.  Storage nodes
are arranged in replica sets to handle replication.</p>

<p>Cassandra provides an order-preserving partitioner if you wish to
allow fast range scans over your data.  Cassandra nodes are still arranged
in a ring using consistent hashing, but rather than hashing a
key-value pair onto the ring to determine the server to which it
should be assigned, the key is simply mapped onto the server which
controls the range in which the key naturally fits.  For example, keys
20 and 21 would both be mapped to server A in our consistent hash ring
in <a href="#fig.nosql.hashring">Figure&nbsp;13.1</a>, rather than being hashed and
randomly distributed in the ring.</p>

<p>Twitter's Gizzard framework for managing partitioned and replicated
data across many back ends uses range partitioning to shard data.
Routing servers form hierarchies of any depth, assigning ranges of
keys to servers below them in the hierarchy.  These servers either
store data for keys in their assigned range, or route to yet another
layer of routing servers.  Replication in this model is achieved by sending
updates to multiple machines for a key range.  Gizzard routing nodes
manage failed writes in different manner than other NoSQL systems.
Gizzard requires that system designers make all updates idempotent
(they can be run twice).  When a storage node fails, routing nodes
cache and repeatedly send updates to the node until the update is
confirmed.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.4.5. Which Partitioning Scheme to Use</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the hash- and range-based approaches to sharding, which is
preferable?  It depends.  Range partitioning is the obvious choice to
use when you will frequently be performing range scans over the keys
of your data.  As you read values in order by key, you will not jump
to random nodes in the network, which would incur heavy network
overhead.  But if you do not require range scans, which sharding
scheme should you use?</p>

<p>Hash partitioning gives reasonable distribution of data across nodes,
and random skew can be reduced with virtual nodes.  Routing is simple
in the hash partitioning scheme: for the most part, the hash function
can be executed by clients to find the appropriate server.  With more
complicated rebalancing schemes, finding the right node for a key
becomes more difficult.</p>

<p>Range partitioning requires the upfront cost of maintaining
routing and configuration nodes, which can see heavy load and become
central points of failure in the absence of relatively complex fault
tolerance schemes.  Done well, however, range-partitioned data can be
load-balanced in small chunks which can be reassigned in high-load
situations.  If a server goes down, its assigned ranges can be
distributed to many servers, rather than loading the server's
immediate neighbors during downtime.</p>

<div class="sect" id="sec.nosql.consistency">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>13.5. Consistency</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having spoken about the virtues of replicating data to multiple
machines for durability and spreading load, it's time to let you in on
a secret: keeping replicas of your data on multiple machines
consistent with one-another is hard.  In practice, replicas will crash
and get out of sync, replicas will crash and never come back, networks
will partition two sets of replicas, and messages between machines
will get delayed or lost.  There are two major approaches to data
consistency in the NoSQL ecosystem.  The first is strong consistency, where all
replicas remain in sync.  The second is eventual consistency, where replicas are
allowed to get out of sync, but eventually catch up with one-another.
Let's first get into why the second option is an appropriate
consideration by understanding a fundamental property of distributed
computing.  After that, we'll jump into the details of each approach.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.5.1. A Little Bit About CAP</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why are we considering anything short of strong consistency guarantees
over our data?  It all comes down to a property of distributed systems
architected for modern networking equipment.  The idea was first
proposed by Eric Brewer as the <em>CAP Theorem</em>, and later proved by
Gilbert and Lynch [<a href="bibliography.html#bib:captheorem">GL02</a>].
The theorem first presents three
properties of distributed systems which make up the acronym CAP:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Consistency</em>: do all replicas of a piece of data always
  logically agree on the same version of that data by the time you
  read it?  (This concept of consistency is different than the C in ACID.)</li>

  <li><em>Availability</em>: Do replicas respond to read and write requests regardless
  of how many replicas are inaccessible?</li>

  <li><em>Partition tolerance</em>: Can the system continue to operate
  even if some replicas temporarily lose the ability to communicate
  with each other over the network?</li>

</ul>

<p>The theorem then goes on to say that a storage system which operates on
multiple computers can only achieve two of these properties at the
expense of a third.  Also, we are forced to implement partition-tolerant
systems.  On current networking
hardware using current messaging protocols, packets can be lost,
switches can fail, and there is no way to know whether the network is
down or the server you are trying to send a message to is unavailable.
All NoSQL systems should be partition-tolerant.  The remaining choice
is between consistency and availability.  No NoSQL system can provide
both at the same time.</p>

<p>Opting for consistency means that your replicated data will not be out
of sync across replicas.  An easy way to achieve consistency is to
require that all replicas acknowledge updates.  If a replica goes down
and you can not confirm data updates on it, then you degrade
availability on its keys.  This means that until all replicas recover and respond, the user can not
receive successful acknowledgment of their update operation.  Thus, opting
for consistency is opting for a lack of round-the-clock availability
for each data item.</p>

<p>Opting for availability means that when a user issues an operation,
replicas should act on the
data they have, regardless of the state of other replicas.  This may
lead to diverging consistency of data across replicas, since they
weren't required to acknowledge all updates, and some replicas may
have not noted all updates.</p>

<p>The implications of the CAP theorem lead to the strong consistency and
eventual consistency approaches to building NoSQL data stores.  Other
approaches exist, such as the relaxed consistency and relaxed
availability approach presented in Yahoo!'s PNUTS
[<a href="bibliography.html#bib:pnuts">CRS+08</a>]
system.  None of
the open source NoSQL systems we discuss has adopted this technique yet,
so we will not discuss it further.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.5.2. Strong Consistency</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Systems which promote strong consistency ensure that the replicas of a
data item will always be able to come to consensus on the value of a
key.  Some replicas may be out of sync with one-another, but when the
user asks for the value of <font size=1><code>employee30:salary</code></font>, the machines have
a way to consistently agree on the value the user sees.  How this
works is best explained with numbers.</p>

<p>Say we replicate a key on N machines.  Some machine, perhaps one of
the <font size=1><code>N</code></font>, serves as a coordinator for each user request.  The
coordinator ensures that a certain number of the <font size=1><code>N</code></font> machines has
received and acknowledged each request.  When a write or update occurs
to a key, the coordinator does not confirm with the user that the
write occurred until <font size=1><code>W</code></font> replicas confirm that they have received
the update.  When a user wants to read the value for some key, the
coordinator responds when at least R have responded with the same
value.  We say that the system exemplifies strong consistency if
<font size=1><code>R+W&gt;N</code></font>.</p>

<p>Putting some numbers to this idea, let's say that we're replicating
each key across N=3 machines (call them <font size=1><code>A</code></font>, <font size=1><code>B</code></font>, and
<font size=1><code>C</code></font>).  Say that the key <font size=1><code>employee30:salary</code></font> is initially set
to the value $20,000, but we want to give <font size=1><code>employee30</code></font> a raise
to $30,000.  Let's require that at least <font size=1><code>W=2</code></font> of <font size=1><code>A</code></font>,
<font size=1><code>B</code></font>, or <font size=1><code>C</code></font> acknowledge each write request for a key.  When
<font size=1><code>A</code></font> and <font size=1><code>B</code></font> confirm the write request for <font size=1><code>(employee30:salary,
$30,000)</code></font>, the coordinator lets the user know that
<font size=1><code>employee30:salary</code></font> is safely updated.  Let's assume that machine
C never received the write request for <font size=1><code>employee30:salary</code></font>, so it
still has the value $20,000.  When a coordinator gets a read request
for key <font size=1><code>employee30:salary</code></font>, it will send that request to all 3
machines:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If we set <font size=1><code>R=1</code></font>, and machine <font size=1><code>C</code></font> responds first with
  $20,000, our employee will not be very happy.</li>

  <li>However, if we set <font size=1><code>R=2</code></font>, the coordinator will see the
  value from <font size=1><code>C</code></font>, wait for a second response from <font size=1><code>A</code></font> or
  <font size=1><code>B</code></font>, which will conflict with <font size=1><code>C</code></font>'s outdated value, and
  finally receive a response from the third machine, which will
  confirm that $30,000 is the majority opinion.</li>

</ul>

<p>So in order to achieve strong consistency in this case, we need to set
<font size=1><code>R</code></font>=2} so that <font size=1><code>R+W</code></font>3}.</p>

<p>What happens when <font size=1><code>W</code></font> replicas do not respond to a write request,
or <font size=1><code>R</code></font> replicas do not respond to a read request with a
consistent response?  The coordinator can timeout eventually and send
the user an error, or wait until the situation corrects itself.
Either way, the system is considered unavailable for that request for
at least some time.</p>

<p>Your choice of <font size=1><code>R</code></font> and <font size=1><code>W</code></font> affect how many machines can act
strangely before your system becomes unavailable for different actions
on a key.  If you force all of your replicas to acknowledge writes,
for example, then <font size=1><code>W=N</code></font>, and write operations will hang or fail
on any replica failure.  A common choice is <font size=1><code>R + W = N + 1</code></font>,
the minimum required for strong consistency while still allowing for
temporary disagreement between replicas.  Many strong consistency
systems opt for <font size=1><code>W=N</code></font> and <font size=1><code>R=1</code></font>, since they then do not have
to design for nodes going out of sync.</p>

<p>HBase bases its replicated storage on HDFS, a distributed storage layer.  HDFS provides strong consistency
guarantees.  In HDFS, a write cannot succeed until it has been
replicated to all <font size=1><code>N</code></font> (usually 2 or 3) replicas, so <font size=1><code>W = N</code></font>.
A read will be satisfied by a single replica, so <font size=1><code>R = 1</code></font>.  To
avoid bogging down write-intensive workloads, data is transferred from
the user to the replicas asynchronously in parallel.  Once all
replicas acknowledge that they have received copies of the data, the
final step of swapping the new data in to the system is performed
atomically and consistently across all replicas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>13.5.3. Eventual Consistency</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dynamo-based systems, which include Voldemort, Cassandra, and Riak,
allow the user to specify <font size=1><code>N</code></font>, <font size=1><code>R</code></font>, and <font size=1><code>W</code></font> to their
needs, even if <font size=1><code>R + W &lt;= N</code></font>.  This means that the user
can achieve either strong or eventual consistency.  When a user picks
eventual consistency, and even when the programmer opts for strong
consistency but <font size=1><code>W</code></font> is less than <font size=1><code>N</code></font>, there are periods in
which replicas might not see eye-to-eye.  To provide eventual
consistency among replicas, these systems employ various tools to
catch stale replicas up to speed.  Let's first cover how various
systems determine that data has gotten out of sync, then discuss how
they synchronize replicas, and finally bring in a few dynamo-inspired
methods for speeding up the synchronization process.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Versioning and Conflicts</h4>

<p>Because two replicas might see two different versions of a value for
some key, data versioning and conflict detection is important.  The
dynamo-based systems use a type of versioning called <em>vector
clocks</em>.  A vector clock is a vector assigned to each key which
contains a counter for each replica.  For example, if
servers <font size=1><code>A</code></font>, <font size=1><code>B</code></font>, and <font size=1><code>C</code></font> are the three replicas of
some key, the vector clock will have three entries, <font size=1><code>(N_A, N_B,
N_C)</code></font>, initialized to <font size=1><code>(0,0,0)</code></font>.</p>

<p>Each time a replica modifies a key, it increments its counter in the
vector.  If B modifies a key that previously had version <font size=1><code>(39, 1,
5)</code></font>, it will change the vector clock to <font size=1><code>(39, 2, 5)</code></font>.  When
another replica, say <font size=1><code>C</code></font>, receives an update from B about the
key's data, it will compare the vector clock from <font size=1><code>B</code></font> to its own.
As long as its own vector clock counters are all less than the ones
delivered from <font size=1><code>B</code></font>, then it has a stale version and can overwrite
its own copy with <font size=1><code>B</code></font>'s.  If <font size=1><code>B</code></font> and <font size=1><code>C</code></font> have clocks in
which some counters are greater than others in both clocks, say
<font size=1><code>(39, 2, 5)</code></font> and <font size=1><code>(39, 1, 6)</code></font>, then the servers recognize
that they received different, potentially unreconcilable updates over
time, and identify a conflict.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Conflict Resolution</h4>

<p>Conflict resolution varies across the different systems.  The Dynamo
paper leaves conflict resolution to the application using the
storage system.  Two versions of a shopping cart can be merged into
one without significant loss of data, but two versions of a
collaboratively edited document might require human reviewer to
resolve conflict.  Voldemort follows this model, returning multiple
copies of a key to the requesting client application upon conflict.</p>

<p>Cassandra, which stores a timestamp on each key, uses the most
recently timestamped version of a key when two versions are in
conflict.  This removes the need for a round-trip to the client and
simplifies the API. This design makes it difficult to handle
situations where conflicted data can be intelligently merged, as in
our shopping cart example, or when implementing distributed counters.
Riak allows both of the approaches offered by Voldemort and Cassandra.
CouchDB provides a hybrid: it identifies a conflict and allows users
to query for conflicted keys for manual repair, but deterministically
picks a version to return to users until conflicts are repaired.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Read Repair</h4>

<p>If R replicas return non-conflicting data to a coordinator, the
coordinator can safely return the non-conflicting data to the
application.  The coordinator may still notice that some of the
replicas are out of sync.  The Dynamo paper suggests, and Cassandra,
Riak, and Voldemort implement, a technique called <em>read repair</em>
for handling such situations.  When a coordinator identifies a
conflict on read, even if a consistent value has been returned to the
user, the coordinator starts conflict-resolution protocols between
conflicted replicas.  This proactively fixes conflicts with little
additional work.  Replicas have already sent their version of the data to
the coordinator, and faster conflict resolution will result in less
divergence in the system.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Hinted Handoff</h4>

<p>Cassandra, Riak, and Voldemort all employ a technique called
<em>hinted handoff</em> to improve write performance for situations
where a node temporarily becomes unavailable. If one of the replicas
for a key does not respond to a write request, another node is
selected to temporarily take over its write workload.  Writes for the
unavailable node are kept separately, and when the backup node notices
the previously unavailable node become available, it forwards all of
the writes to the newly available replica.  The Dynamo paper utilizes
a 'sloppy quorum' approach and allows the writes accomplished through
hinted handoff to count toward the W required write acknowledgments.
Cassandra and Voldemort will not count a hinted handoff against W, and
will fail a write which does not have W confirmations from the
originally assigned replicas.  Hinted handoff is still useful in these
systems, as it speeds up recovery when an unavailable node returns.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Anti-Entropy</h4>

<p>When a replica is down for an extended period of time, or the machine
storing hinted handoffs for an unavailable replica goes down as well,
replicas must synchronize from one-another.  In this case, Cassandra
and Riak implement a Dynamo-inspired process called
<em>anti-entropy</em>.  In anti-entropy, replicas exchange <em>Merkle
Trees</em> to identify parts of their replicated key ranges which are
out of sync.  A Merkle tree is a hierarchical hash verification: if
the hash over the entire keyspace is not the same between two
replicas, they will exchange hashes of smaller and smaller portions of
the replicated keyspace until the out-of-sync keys are identified.
This approach reduces unnecessary data transfer between replicas which
contain mostly similar data.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Gossip</h4>

<p>Finally, as distributed systems grow, it is hard to keep track of how
each node in the system is doing.  The three Dynamo-based systems
employ an age-old high school technique known as <em>gossip</em> to keep
track of other nodes.  Periodically (every second or so), a node will
pick a random node it once communicated with to exchange knowledge of
the health of the other nodes in the system.  In providing this
exchange, nodes learn which other nodes are down, and know where to
route clients in search of a key.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>13.6. A Final Word</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NoSQL ecosystem is still in its infancy, and many of the
systems we've discussed will change architectures, designs, and
interfaces.  The important takeaways in this chapter are not what
each NoSQL system currently does, but rather the design decisions that
led to a combination of features that make up these systems.  NoSQL
leaves a lot of design work in the hands of the application designer.
Understanding the architectural components of these systems will not
only help you build the next great NoSQL amalgamation, but also allow
you to use current versions responsibly.</p>
