The files with extension .dia were generated by the Dia application.

                   http://projects.gnome.org/dia/

From Dia, the figures were exported as EPS, in files with .eps extension.

These files were then converted to PDF by using the command:

                      epstopdf    figure.eps

For convenience, the resulting .pdf file has been committed to this
SVN repository. However, the actual source of the diagrams are the
files with extensions .dia.


The files with extension .gnuplot are in put to the plotting program
gnuplot. They produce .ps files as output, that then were converted
to pdf by calling ps2pdf.
