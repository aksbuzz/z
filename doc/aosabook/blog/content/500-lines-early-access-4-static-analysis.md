Today we've [published the fourth
chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/static-analysis.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Leah
Hanson](https://twitter.com/astrieanna).

Many programmers treat their programming language implementations as black
boxes. Static analysis tools or language analysis tools can seem
indistinguishable from magic, and good treatments of these topics have been
buried deep in academic curricula that few of us make time for.

In our opinion, Leah has done a terrific job of demystifying the nature of the
techniques used in static analysis and introspection in her chapter. While her
work is specific to [Julia](http://julialang.org/), the lessons learned are
applicable in other languages. Enjoy!

If you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our

We'd also like to take this opportunity to remind our readers that this book
would not have been possible without the financial support of
[PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com/). Please take this opportunity to [let them
know](https://twitter.com/pagerduty) if you've found this work useful.

Enjoy!
