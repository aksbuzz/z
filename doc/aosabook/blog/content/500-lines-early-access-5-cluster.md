Today we've [published the fifth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/clustering-by-consensus.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Dustin J. Mitchell](https://github.com/djmitche).

Donald Knuth once said that the best theory is motivated by practice, and the best practice by theory. In this chapter, Dustin does something that many programmers have do at least once in their career; he implements a rather opaque algorithm from primary sources (PAXOS) that solves a very practical problem (distributed consensus.) He then demonstrates how sound engineering practices allow us to implement something that at first seems slightly beyond our capability, and to convince ourselves that it actually works. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
