We're very happy to announce that [PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com) will be
sponsoring the production of ["500 Lines or Less"](http://github.com/aosabook/500lines), 
the fourth book in the Architecture of Open Source Applications series.

The AOSA books are published and distributed on a not-for-profit basis, with
all of our proceeds going to Amnesty International. However, there are always labor
costs associated with the production of each book. With PagerDuty's support, we
will be able to continue to donate all of the book's proceeds while still
covering these costs. 

PagerDuty is well-known for its strong engineering culture, and we feel that
they are the perfect partner to support the kind of work we're doing with AOSA.

We are very grateful for their support. If you are too, please let them know
[@PagerDuty](https://twitter.com/pagerduty), or
