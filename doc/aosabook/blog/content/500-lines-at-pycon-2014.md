Are you coming to [PyCon 2014](http://pycon.us)? If so, we invite you to join
us at the [500 Lines or Less](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines) Open Space!

The purpose of the Open Space is to discuss some sample programs and chapters
that have been written so far, and to brainstorm possible directions that this
work could take from here. 

The open space is at __1PM on Sunday April 14th in room 522A__.

There's no requirement to sign up beforehand -- all you have to do is show up.

Hope to see you there!
