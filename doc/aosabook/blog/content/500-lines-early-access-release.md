It has been a long time coming, but I'm happy to announce that the first
artifact from 500 Lines or Less will be published on aosabook.org today.

Writing a chapter for 500 Lines is a rigorous process. The code for
each chapter is first reviewed by technical reviewers; then, the chapter drafts
are reviewed by different readers for content and accessibility. Finally, our
heroic copy editor Amy Brown examines each line of text for grammatical errors
or tricky phrasings. And yet, we're sure there are still bugs in this book
waiting to be found.

Just as it is very expensive to fix a bug once it hits production, it is
similarly painful to find an error in a book once it has already gone to print.
To this end, we're going to be doing an early-access release of each chapter on
the 500Lines website at the rate of one per week for the next 20 weeks. We hope
that getting these chapters out early will give all of you the chance to find
the snags that we missed throughout this process. We expect to go to print very
shortly after this process winds down. 

These early-access chapters will only be published from this blog, and will be
linked from the news section on
[aosabook.org](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) and announced on Twitter from
[@aosabook](https://twitter.com/aosabook). The production version of the
website will be published around the same time as the final draft goes to
print.

With all of that out of the way, I'm happy to share [Ned Batchelder's](https://twitter.com/nedbat)
[template engine chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-template-engine.html)
with you. Ned's chapter is a great example of what we were hoping to
accomplish with 500Lines: it is compact, well-explained, and there are several
discussions of interesting decisions and trade-offs he had to make while writing
it. 

If you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). We'll try our
best to collate issues sent to us on Twitter and via other channels, but we
have a lot of book to work on still, and we're probably going to miss things
unless they're persisted in that tracker somehow.

Many thanks again to
[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/company/work-with-us/) for their generous
sponsorship of this project.  Please give them a
[public thank-you or two](https://twitter.com/pagerduty) throughout this
early-access release for their contribution.
