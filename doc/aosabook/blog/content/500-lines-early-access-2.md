Today we've [published the second
chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/web-spreadsheet.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. [Audrey Tang](https://twitter.com/audreyt) has contributed
chapters to
[two](http://aosabook.org/en/posa/from-socialcalc-to-ethercalc.html)
[previous](http://aosabook.org/en/socialcalc.html) volumes of AOSA, and we're
very happy to have her back for ["500 Lines or
Less."](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines)

When Audrey's chapter was first presented to readers, many protested at how
dependent it was on external frameworks and libraries. This is only half of the
truth; Instead of just leveraging these components, Audrey provides a miniature
ontology for the kinds of patterns that web programmers can expect to use now
and in the future. (For the curious, there is also a [99-line version that uses
only DOM
APIs](https://github.com/audreyt/500lines/tree/master/spreadsheet/as-without-angularjs).)

Most engineers spend a lot of time figuring out how to build software based on
the work of others. We feel that reading about how an experienced engineer
identifies the patterns in software she is reusing is a valuable lesson for us
all.

This chapter was written _way back_ in 2014 when Traceur was the leading ES6
compiler implementation. Audrey has informed us that she probably would have
used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) if she was writing this chapter now. If
you are interested in updating the source and the chapter to reflect this,
we're open to pull requests!

If you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Audrey also helpfully translated her chapter into Traditional Chinese; you can
find the source for this version
[here](https://github.com/audreyt/500lines/blob/master/spreadsheet/chapter.zh-tw.md). 

Enjoy!
