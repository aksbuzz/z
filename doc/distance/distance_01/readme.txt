Hello. Thanks for supporting Distance. It's basically just me working with others to write great things, and I really appreciate that you helped us keep the lights on. This is the first issue, and I'm tremendously excited about it.

Here's what's in the digital bundle:

- distance-01.pdf: The PDF of the first issue.
- distance-01.epub: The ePub of the first issue. Load this onto a Nook or into iBooks.
- distance-01.mobi: The Kindle edition of the first issue. Email this file to your _____@kindle.com email address, which should be listed in the settings on your device.
- distance-01-discussion.pdf: Comments and discussion about the first issue. You could be in this! Take a look inside for more information.
- vitorio-response_card.zip: The response card for local community organizers that Vitorio Miliano discusses in his essay.

And I think that's all you need. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as we've all enjoyed creating it. I can't believe that I get to work on something as cool as this every day, and it's your support that helps make that happen.

Take care,
