Hello. Thanks for supporting Distance. It's basically just me (Nick Disabato) working with others to write great things, and I really appreciate that you helped us keep the lights on. This is our second issue.

Here's what's in the digital bundle:

- distance-02.pdf: The PDF of the second issue.
- distance-02.epub: The ePub of the second issue. Load this onto a Nook or into iBooks.
- distance-02.mobi: The Kindle edition of the second issue. Email this file to your _____@kindle.com email address, which should be listed in the settings on your device.

And I think that's all you need. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as we've all enjoyed creating it. I can't believe that I get to work on something as cool as this every day, and it's your support that helps make that happen.

Take care,
--
