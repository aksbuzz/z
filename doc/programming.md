# programming
General programming knowledge, useful tidbits and parts to pick up along the
way.

## Meta programming
Programming on a higher level; not bound by languages.

## Debugging
There's only so much humans can do to prevent bugs. Languages like `rust` are
appealing because once you get them running they will not crash. These are some
methods humans can use to find out why computers aren't doing what you ought
them to do.

- triage (printing)
- disinfect (linting)
- monitor (logging)
- traces (stack traces)
- test (test cases)
- scan (???)
- probe (dynamic tracing in dynamic langs)
- observe (direct interaction)
- intervene (built-in debugger)
- operate (inspector tooling)
- biopsy (resource leaks)
- postmortem (gdb / lldb)
