## I know it's good practice to split all these into individual files in
## `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`, but I also know I never will. Some scripts
## will go ahead and create their own file there... those get tacked on
## to this file, and any cron jobs or what have you related to those
## gets deleted.
## There's also `unused.list`, which isn't *completely* unused...
## it's just all the extra repos that I access once in a very rare
## while, but don't need to actually check when I update packages.
## Actual debian repos (sid and experimental, main non-free contrib)
## are in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
